<p>The days of <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/" target="_blank">GOTO Aarhus 2014</a> are getting  closer and closer and it's about time for me to review the conference schedule and sketch my way though it. The conference is structured around 4 tracks, friendly categorized from the attendee perspective as <em>What is Never Ending</em>, <em>What is Now</em>, <em>What is New</em>, <em>What is Next</em>, and a <em>Solution Track</em>. The full conference schedule can be found <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/schedule/index.jsp" target="_blank">here</a> and I plan on shifting my way around the tracks and attend the following:</p>
<h3><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/presentation/Scaling%20Pinterest" target="_blank">Scaling Pinterest, by Marty Weiner</a></h3>
<p>Scaling is a subject that I find extremely interesting and challenging, mostly because scaling is such a non-forgiving beast. Most programming errors, or badly developed software, quickly surfaces up as penalty in the speed of your services, websites, or whatever you are developing. Putting bugs and lazy programmers aside, scaling is also greatly affected by architecture. While some architecture solutions are natively scalable, others aren't, therefore knowing the scaling story, errors, and bad decisions made at Pinterest can only help you in the long run, by learning from others mistakes, not yours (which are more expensive).</p>
<h3><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=6420" target="_blank">Look, no Mocks! Functional TDD with F#, by Mark Seemann</a></h3>
<p>Being a strong believer in automated testing, I always look for ways to better my style of automated testing. Moreover, maybe this talk will finally spark some interest into functional programming and get me into it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/presentation/Event-sourcing" target="_blank">Event-sourcing, by Greg Young</a></h3>
<p>One can simply not get enough presentations about Event Sourcing. Even though I have almost finished watching the dreaded <a href="http://cqrs.wordpress.com/video/" target="_blank">6 hours long video</a> on event sourcing I feel I could still use a refresh on the subject. But maybe I should stop watching and start doing...</p>
<h3><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/presentation/A%20retake%20on%20the%20Agile%20Manifesto%20Part%20I" target="_blank">A retake on the Agile Manifesto, by Jez Humble, Katherine Kirk, Prag-Dave Thomas, and Martin Fowler</a></h3>
<p>Throughout my programming life I experienced several "agility levels" at my workplaces, some companies were more agile than advertised, other less agile than advertised, however the common denominator here is "advertise". While this talk will certainly bring back some bad memories, I definitely look forward to see where we are headed...</p>
<p>As of now, this is my way through the first day of the conference, however later on I might mutate this schedule</p>
