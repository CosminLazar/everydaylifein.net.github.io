<h1>Git</h1>
<p>One of the best source control systems out there is <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>, it's free and open source. It's functionality is exposed via the command line, but most developers prefer to use a user interface to interact with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Git Extensions" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/" target="_blank">Git Extensions</a> - integrates nicely with Windows and Visual Studio (free)</li>
<li><a title="SourceTree" href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> - standalone client with a nice and powerful UI (free)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Direct usage of the command line git client depends on the geek and command line fanboy level exhibited by the individual. Personally, I use a combination of the two, however, when time allows, I always try to do more complicated things from the command line, rather than using some UI. </span></p>
<p>And now I found a good way to further my git skills by playing several games.</p>
<h1>The Git game</h1>
<p>A simple game that tests your git command line skills. Divided in several levels, it will use your skills to resolve conflicts, blame, view and traverse commits, and other challenges. To get you started, all you have to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>checkout the game <em><strong>git clone https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game.git</strong></em></li>
<li>open the README file - there you will find instructions and riddles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project is hosted on github at  <a href="https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game" target="_blank">https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game</a></p>
<h1>Learn Git branching</h1>
<p>Focuses on teaching you how git branching actually works and delves into several commands offering good visualisations.</p>
<p>You can play it here: <a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/" target="_blank">http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
